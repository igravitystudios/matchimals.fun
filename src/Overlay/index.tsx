// A dependency-free portal for native. RN has no createPortal for native, and
// its built-in Modal collapses its content frame on the New Architecture
// (Fabric), which breaks full-screen overlays. Instead we keep the mounted
// overlays in a tiny module-level store and render them in a single full-screen
// host at the app root. The store is deliberately OUTSIDE React state so that
// mounting/updating an overlay only re-renders the host- never the whole app
// (which previously caused an infinite render loop). Because the host lives
// below the app's providers, portaled content still sees PlayerProvider, Music,
// safe-area, etc.
